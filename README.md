ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a developer with a diverse skill set. I have a strong preference for working with WPF in C#, and I also enjoy developing mobile applications using Flutter. Python is another language I prefer for various projects.

Currently, I am working as a machine learning engineer, but I'm always willing to help in my free time. My toolkit includes:

* Languages: C#, Python, C++, TypeScript, Dart, Kotlin, Javascript and some Go.
* Libraries/Frameworks: Flutter, React, Django, Electron.
* Tools: Visual Studio, VSCode, PyCharm, WebStorm, CLion, GoLand, Android Studio.
* CI/CD: Proficient in using Azure DevOps for continuous integration and deployment.
